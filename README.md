# Project-Horiseon-refrac-code-!
This is a challenge centred around making use of semantic HTML to improve user accessibility and refractoring original code (honouring the coding scout rule - "Always leave the code better than you found it"). 

# User Story

Usage:
This webpage has been updated for ease of user accessibility and has been better optimised for search engines (i.e google)
